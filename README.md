# DataVisualisation
This is a project that investigates the relationship between the birthrate in Canada and the changes in female workforce participation between 1960-2015.
In this project I have plotted the changes in Birthrate in Canada over time and noted a significant fall in the rate over the last 4 decades. 
To investigate the causal relationship, I plotted Canadian GDP and the ratio of Female to Male participation over the same time-period. 
There was a strong inverse correlation between rising Canadian GDP, rising Female to Male workforce participation and the fall in Birthrate 
in Canada over the last 4 decades. 
For a sense check, I also found that the average birthrate of OECD countries matched the birthrate in Canada in 2011. Thus concluding that
the factors that lead to a fall in Canada's Birthrate (i.e. economic growth & an increase in female workforce participation) were seen across
all OECD countries to some degree.
